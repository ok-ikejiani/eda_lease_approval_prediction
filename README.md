# Exploratory Data Analysis for Predicting Leasing Approvals

**Author: Ok Ikejiani**

## Executive summary
### Context

Our client, a Canadian-based equipment leasing company (hereafter referred to as "the Client") specializes in purchasing and leasing equipment to various businesses across Canada. The Client collaborates with a network of funders who provide the capital necessary for each lease agreement. Companies seeking to lease equipment submit applications to the Client, who then works to get these applications approved by their funders.

Successful approvals are crucial for the Client's business growth and reputation among funders. Funders often limit the number of deals they process at a time due to risk management concerns. However, they are more inclined to increase this limit when they observe that a broker consistently submits applications that are approved and lead to successful leases. Each approved application that defaults not only results in financial loss but also represents a significant opportunity cost, affecting the Client's credibility with funders.

Currently, the Client invests considerable time and resources into due diligence, including extensive back-and-forth communications and on-site business visits. While this thorough process helps in securing approvals, it is not scalable without proportionally increasing headcountâ€”a challenge the Client aims to overcome. With the recent migration from a paper-based system to a digital application portal (Phase 1 of their digital transformation), the Client has experienced an influx of applications. They now receive hundreds of requests weekly and need an efficient way to prioritize these applications to maximize successful approvals.

Leveraging artificial intelligence presents a new opportunity (Phase 2 of their transformation) to help the Client scale their operations without significantly increasing personnel by predicting the likelihood of application approvals and focusing efforts on the most promising candidates.

### Problem Statement

The Client seeks to enhance their leasing approval process by predicting the likelihood of application approvals based on available data. This predictive capability will enable them to:
Increase the number of successful applications submitted to funders.
Prioritize organizations with a higher chance of approval.
Scale their operations efficiently without a significant increase in headcount.

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of lease application approvals. By analyzing historical application data and identifying key factors that influence funder decisions, the Client can optimize their application submission strategy. The model will help in:
- Streamlining the due diligence process by focusing on high-probability approvals.
- Enhancing relationships with funders by consistently submitting quality applications.
- Allocating resources effectively to handle the most promising leads.

## Research Question

Can we predict the likelihood of lease application approvals for Canadian companies looking to lease equipment and software in a way that minimizes poor leads without missing opportunities?

An addtional Research Question is, Do external factors such as interest rates have an impact on the approval of lease applications?

## Rationale(Why this question is important?)

Efficiently processing lease applications is crucial for the company's growth and sustainability in a competitive market. With the recent influx of applications due to the new digital portal, the company faces the challenge of prioritizing which applications to focus on without overwhelming their resources or increasing headcount.
By answering this question, the company stands to gain significant benefits:
- Resource Optimization: Predicting approval likelihood allows the company to allocate time and effort toward applications that are more likely to be approved, reducing wasted resources on low-probability cases.
- Operational Scalability: Implementing a predictive model enables the company to handle a higher volume of applications efficiently, supporting business growth without the need for proportional staff increases.
- Enhanced Funder Relationships: Consistently presenting high-quality applications improves the company's reputation with funders, which may lead to increased funding limits and better terms, directly impacting profitability.
- Strategic Decision-Making: Understanding the key factors that influence approvals empowers the company to guide applicants on improving their profiles, potentially increasing overall approval rates.
- Competitive Advantage: Leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling positions the company ahead of competitors who may not utilize such advanced techniques, attracting more business and fostering customer trust.

## Data Sources

There were two main data sources used in this project:

### Client Database and Excel Files
Historical application data extracted from the clients database and Excel files.

### Bank of Canada Interest Rates
Historical interest rates from the Bank of Canada used as a proxy for the cost of funds at the time of each application.  While not a perfect match, these rates closely reflect the trends in funders' cost of capital and can significantly impact approval decisions.

## Methodology:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
In the initial phase of the process, I focused on gaining a deep understanding of the dataset. Key steps included:
- Visualizing the distribution of important features such as company location, annual revenue, and other relevant variables.
- Checking for missing values and identifying outliers to ensure that the data was clean and accurate for analysis.
- Analyzing the relationships between various features and the target variable (approval status), which helped provide insights into patterns that might influence approval decisions.
- I also analyzed the relationship between the interest rates and the approval status of the lease applications.

### Data Cleaning and Splitting:
- Data was cleaned by dropping unused columns and rows with missing values.
- The dataset was split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data effectively.
- Cross-validation was used to ensure that the model was generalizing well and not overfitting to the training data.
- The funding data was found to be imbalanced, so SMOTE was used to generate synthetic data for the minority class. Undersampling was not used because it was found to be less effective than SMOTE.
### 2. Feature Engineering:
- Polynomial features were generated to capture nonlinear relationships between features.
- Age was derived from the Incorporation Date.
- Categorical variables were encoded using both ordinal and one-hot encoding to ensure proper handling by the models, and I standardized features to prepare them for machine learning algorithms.


### Model Selection:
- A DummyClassifier model was trained to get a baseline model to compare the performance of the other models.
- Multiple models were then trained and used to predict lease approvals, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest.
- Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Grid Search to optimize model performance and ensure that the models were appropriately configured.
- Finally, a Bagging ensembale model was used to improve the performance of the top model.
  
### Model Evaluation:
- The trained models were evalutated on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to assess how well they balanced minimizing poor leads without missing opportunities. The primary metric used was *F1-score*. F1 Score was chosen because it is a balanced metric that considers both precision and recall, which are crucial for this project. While we want to miniminze the chances of approving poor leads, we also want to avoid missing opportunities to approve good leads which is why F1 Score is a good metric to use.
- Feature importance was also analyzed to understand which factors, such as company location, annual revenue, and lease history, had the greatest impact on lease approval predictions.


## Results
### Data Overview
#### Lease Applications Data
- The 'Lease Amount' column appears to be normally distributed, with a median of 100,000 and a mean of $124,951.
- The 'Annual Revenue' column also has a few outliers, The majority of the companies have relatively low annual revenues, but there are some outliers with significantly higher revenues, which results in a skewed distribution.This insight is important because it indicates that revenue may not be evenly distributed across companies, and outliers could heavily influence statistical analyses like averages.
- The 'Year Incorporated' column has a few outliers, with some companies reporting incorporation dates in the early 1960s.
- The 'Lease Term' column appears to be evenly distributed, with most leases ranging from 1 to 5 years.
- Data Quality Issues: Missing values in Equimpent Type, Buiness Type are all Corporations which does not aid in analysis
- The target variable is imbalanced, with less denied applications than approved applications.

#### Interest Rates Data
- Observed Data: The interest rates show clear fluctuations over time. There are periods where the rates remain stable, followed by a noticeable decline, then a gradual rise.
- Trend: The overall trend suggests a general decline in rates over the middle section of the observed period, followed by a slight increase toward the end.
- Seasonality: The rates exhibit clear seasonality, with repeating patterns indicating that rates fluctuate in a predictable manner throughout the year.
- Residuals: The residual plot reveals some irregular fluctuations, indicating that there are variations in the data that are not explained by the trend or seasonality. This might suggest the presence of external factors affecting the rates that are not captured in the decomposition.
- Clusters in Rate Distribution: The rates are clustered around specific values (e.g., 0.75%, 0.50%, 2.00%), which could represent key interest rate levels set by central banks or other regulatory bodies. The spikes in the histogram could also point to economic interventions or rate adjustments.
- Data Quality Issues: The presence of unusual labels like "Bank Holiday" in the rate distribution suggests there may be data entry inconsistencies that need to be addressed for further analysis.

#### Combined Data
- The heatmap reveals that none of the variables are strongly correlated with each other, with most correlation coefficients hovering around zero. This indicates that there are no obvious linear relationships between key variables such as Lease Amount, Annual Revenue, Year Incorporated, Lease Term, and Rate in the dataset.
- The weak correlations suggest that other factors, perhaps non-linear relationships or external variables not included in this dataset, may be influencing lease decisions and outcomes.
- The z-score analysis identified 195 outliers in the dataset, which could skew the results of the analysis if not addressed.

### Best Performing Model
The best performaning model was the Bagging model with a SVC model as the base estimator(F1 Score of 0.9). However, both the Random Forest tree and just the SVC model performed very similarly well, with the difference between F1 Scores being relatively small.

The feature importance plot shows that the most important features in predicting the likelihood of lease application approvals are the Lease term. 
1. Lease Term has the highest importance, meaning the length of the lease is a major factor in predicting approval. This makes sense as longer lease terms might signal higher risk or commitment from the funderâ€™s perspective.
2. Lease Amount is also highly significant, suggesting that the size of the lease is critical in determining approval likelihood.
3. Funder ID, Years in Business, and Rate follow in importance, indicating that both the identity of the funding institution and the stability of the applicant's business (years in operation and rates) are key factors in approval decisions.
4. Other features like Industry Sector, Annual Revenue, Company Location, and Company Size contribute less but still play a role in the model.

## Next steps
- Test addtional models such as XGBoost to see if they perform better.
- Futher feature engineering techniques such as creating a new feature that combines multiple variables to capture complex relationships between features or removing features that had a negative impact on the model's performance.
- Additonal hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model.
- Prepare the best performing model for deployment to be used by the client along side their current system(not to replace, but to test how well it is able to predict the approval of lease applications).
- Investigate inconsistency of bagging model performance that flucutates when the estimator property is used instead of base estimator property.
- Explore other external factors that may have an impact on the approval of lease applications.
